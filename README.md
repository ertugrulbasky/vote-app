# How to Run the Project 

After forking or downloading the project, the necessary packages need to be installed with the "npm install" command in the folder where the project is located.

Then the application can be started with the "npm run start" command.

# About the project

This is a simple survey application. It is an application that allows voting with the vote button next to each question, giving detailed information about the question with the detail button, and adding new questions with the create question button.
